The growth with empty values means that the export in year 2021 from March to October was zero.\nUsing the anomaly definition 97 export categories stand out. It is interesting that there are 23 categories of sanctioned exports to Russia which experienced triple digit growth.\nThe biggest of anomalous exports in term of value are motor cars. Lithuania topping the list with 141 millions euro export to Belarus which doubled compared to previous year. Germany exports of motor cars to Belarus and Russia grew ~7 times for cars with cylinder capacity between 1.5 and 2 litres. Germany exports of motor cars with cylinder capacity larger than 2 litres grew 25 times. This amounted to 361 milion euro of exports after the war.\nPoland exported 139 millions of euro worth turbojets to Kazakhstan, and these exports grew 2 times. Czechia exported 162 millions euro of smartphones to Kazakhstan and Armenia , which is notable as in 2021 there were no such exports at the same period.\nLatvia exported 34 millions euro worth of sparling wine to Russia and these exports grew 4 times.\nGreece exported 58 millions euro worth of jet fuel to Georgia. These exports grew by ~3400 times compared to similar period in 2021."
