It is interesting that there are 25` categories of sanctioned exports to Russia which experienced triple digit growth.\nThe biggest of anomalous exports in term of value are motor cars. Lithuania topping the list with 173 millions euro export to Belarus which tripled compared to previous year. Germany exports of motor cars to Belarus and Russia grew ~8 times for cars with cylinder capacity between 1.5 and 2 litres. Germany exports of motor cars to Belarus with cylinder capacity larger than 2 litres grew 26 times. These Germany exports amounted to 422 milion euro of exports after the war.\nPoland exported 139 millions of euro worth turbojets to Kazakhstan, and these exports grew 3 times. Czechia exported 233 millions euro of smartphones to Kazakhstan, Armenia and Georgia after the war, which is notable as in 2021 there were no such exports at the same period.\nLatvia exported 43 millions euro worth of sparling wine to Russia and these exports grew 4 times.\nGreece exported 75 millions euro worth of jet fuel to Georgia. These exports grew by ~4500 times compared to similar period in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe growth with empty values in the table means that the export in year 2021 from March to November was zero. The full name of exported goods appears if you hover on truncated name."
